There are some code written with tensorflow.
Experiment_imdb and my_work_imdb files: includes some code related to attention model and clockwork-RNN experimented on IMDB dataset.
My_work and my_work_semeval: includes some code related to LSTM network, attention model and clockwork-RNN experimented on Semeval-2017 dataset.
Those code might not achieve a great accuracy rate, and can be improved in the future.
The dataset is too big to load in github, but they can be found in another place.
